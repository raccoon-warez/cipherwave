## Technical Architecture

### Core Classes
```javascript
class VoiceManager {
    // Main voice message management system
    // Handles recording, playback, UI, and WebRTC integration
}

class VoiceMessageManager extends VoiceManager {
    // Backward compatibility layer
}
```

### Key Methods
- `startRecording()` - Initiates voice recording with permission handling
- `stopRecording()` - Stops recording and shows preview modal
- `playVoiceMessage()` - Plays voice messages with waveform visualization
- `handleIncomingVoiceMessage()` - Processes received voice messages
- `setupAudioAnalysis()` - Configures Web Audio API for waveform visualization
- `displayVoiceMessage()` - Renders voice message bubbles in chat

### Audio Processing Pipeline
1. **Permission Request** â†’ MediaDevices.getUserMedia()
2. **Stream Setup** â†’ AudioContext + AnalyserNode for visualization
3. **Recording** â†’ MediaRecorder with optimized settings
4. **Processing** â†’ Blob creation and waveform generation
5. **Preview** â†’ Modal with playback controls and speed adjustment
6. **Transmission** â†’ Base64 encoding for WebRTC data channel
7. **Playback** â†’ Audio element with progress tracking

## Integration Points

### WebRTC Data Channel
```javascript
// Automatic integration with existing CipherWave WebRTC system
if (data.type === 'voice-message') {
    window.voiceManager.handleIncomingVoiceMessage(data);
}
```

### Encryption Support
- Voice messages are encrypted using existing CipherWave encryption
- Supports AES-256, RSA, and ChaCha20 ciphers
- Automatic encryption/decryption in data transmission

### UI Integration
- Seamlessly integrates with existing Telegram-like UI
- Voice button automatically inserted into input area
- Maintains consistent design language and theming

## Accessibility Compliance

### WCAG 2.1 AA Standards
- âœ… Keyboard navigation support (Space bar shortcuts)
- âœ… Screen reader announcements for all state changes
- âœ… ARIA labels and roles for all interactive elements
- âœ… High contrast mode support
- âœ… Reduced motion preferences respected
- âœ… Focus management and visual indicators
- âœ… Skip links for keyboard users

### Mobile Accessibility
- âœ… Touch targets minimum 44px (WCAG 2.5.5)
- âœ… Haptic feedback for visual feedback alternatives
- âœ… Voice-over compatibility on iOS
- âœ… TalkBack compatibility on Android

## Performance Optimizations

### Audio Processing
- **Web Audio API**: Efficient real-time analysis with 256-point FFT
- **RequestAnimationFrame**: Smooth 60fps waveform animations
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of audio contexts and streams
- **Compression**: Optimal bitrate selection based on quality settings

### UI Performance
- **Passive Event Listeners**: Touch events don't block scrolling
- **CSS Containment**: Isolated repaints for waveform canvas
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Efficient message list handling
- **Debounced Resize**: Optimized responsive behavior

## Browser Support
